## Devlog
When looking at the three elements of game designing 
on Unity: Scenes, GameObjects, and Components, I’d 
like to compare and picture it to the idea of 
filmmaking or performing a play. First things first,
we have the Scene. The Scene functions similarly to
a stage, a canvas, or an idea in the head for the
director- it exists in the mind but still needs to
be executed physically. To bring the idea to life
on this so-called “stage”, this is where Gameobjects
come along. GameObjects play as the generic core
elements of the play/scene. We know to make a play 
we need things such as actors, a set, lighting, music,
so on and so forth. GameObjects serve as those
very broad categories that need to be added to the 
Scene. Finally, the last element is the components 
which are the inner content within GameObjects.
Components are very specific and provide more details
as to what exactly is presented in the scene. 
We know that for this play, the stager needs actors,
but the components are the specific character and
actors that the scene specifically calls for. Or if
the play needs a set what exactly does the set need
to look like for this scene? In conclusion, we have
a stage/plot (scene), we know the basic blueprints
(GameObjects) and the specific details (Components),
put them all together and here we have ourselves a 
play (a game)!
